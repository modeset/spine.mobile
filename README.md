Spine.Mobile
------------

This is a fork of Alex MacCaw's excellent [Spine.Mobile](https://github.com/maccman/spine.mobile) library, incorporating a number of tweaks and additions we've found useful in production apps.


A few highlights:

* [Zepto.js](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) support in Panel/Stage
* Streamlined Panel/Stage implementations that don't make assumptions about header/footer structure
* Transitions that play a bit nicer with Zepto and Webkit
* A scrolling panel that integrates nicely with the Modeset.js scroller (coming soon)
* A Spine.Request object that provides a common wrapper around API URLs and AJAX options
* A template for simple Singletons
